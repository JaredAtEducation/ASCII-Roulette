# ASCII-Roulette
I created a text-based roulette game using ncurses that also uses ASCII for the table and wheel to create a cool experience.

To play, just download both files and put them in the same location. Don't worry about not having a save file already, when you start the game, it will automatically create one. 

If you don't have Curses already installed, here is the pip install for it if you are on Windows: 

pip install curses

To play the game, just use the arrow keys to choose an action and hit Enter.

Additionally, if you are on the betting menu, just put any bet in if you want to access the end program button; the bet you made previously won't save, only your money will.

Finally, you cannot bet on more than one thing, only singles, rows, 12ths, halfs and the type of number (red, black, even, odd).

Enjoy!
